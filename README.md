# Motorcycle Enthusiasts Project - Davao City

A project-based learning platform for motorcycle enthusiasts in Davao City, developed with **React Native** for the mobile frontend and **Spring Boot** with **PostgreSQL** on the backend, following official Spring documentation and best practices.

---

##  Overview

This project focuses on building a real-time ride creation and discovery system. It integrates **Mapbox** for interactive maps, **Cloudinary** for storing map snapshots, and uses **Nominatim API** for geolocation. A **Bucket4j** rate limiter ensures compliance with Nominatim's usage policy (1 request per second). **JWT-based authentication** secures API access. It also uses official **PSGC data** from the [Philippine Statistics Authority](https://psa.gov.ph/classification/psgc) to convert coordinates into barangay-level locations. **Redis** integration for managing live user locations is planned.

---

##  Current Progress

*  Create and display rides
*  Interactive **homepage** and **map interface**
*  **Add locations** via **Nominatim API**
*  **Rate limiting** with **Bucket4j** (1 request/sec)
*  **Mapbox integration** â€“ capture and view map snapshots
*  **Cloudinary integration** â€“ upload and store map images
*  **JWT-based authentication** â€“ secure API access with token-based login
*  **PSGC mapping** â€“ match coordinates to barangays using PSA official codes
* (Soon) **Redis** â€“ for storing and managing real-time user locations
* (Soon) **WebSocket** â€“ for live ride and location updates

##  Project Setup Guide

### 1. ðŸ“„ Create a `.env` File

Create a `.env` file in the project root directory and add the following environment variables:

```env
# PostgreSQL Database Configuration
POSTGRES_DB_URL=your_database_host
POSTGRES_DB_USERNAME=your_database_user
POSTGRES_DB_PASSWORD=your_database_password
#JWT Secret
JWT_SECRET=
JWT_EXPIRATION=
# Cloudinary API
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_cloudinary_api_key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_cloudinary_api_secret
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloudinary_cloud_name

# Nominatim API
NOMINATIM_API_KEY=your_nominatim_api_key

# Mapbox API
MAPBOX_API_KEY=your_mapbox_api_key



NOMINATIM_URL_REVERSE=your api url for geo reverse
NOMINATIM_URL_SEARCH = you api to search location
NOMINATIM_USERAGENT= email

NOMINATIM_VIEWBOX_LEFT=120.0
NOMINATIM_VIEWBOX_BOTTOM=10.0
NOMINATIM_VIEWBOX_RIGHT=122.0
NOMINATIM_VIEWBOX_TOP=12.0

```

>  Make sure your `.env` file is **not committed** to version control.

### 2.  Import PSGC Data

There are two ways to import PSGC data into the database:

#### Option 1: Use the built-in import script

Run the following command:

```bash
python ./react/utils/import.py
```

Ensure your PostgreSQL server is running and credentials match those in your `.env` file.

#### Option 2: Manually download and import the official PSA dataset

1. Go to [https://psa.gov.ph/classification/psgc](https://psa.gov.ph/classification/psgc)
2. Look in the attachments section and download:
   **"PSGC 1Q 2025 Publication Datafile"**
3. Open the dataset in your spreadsheet editor or script and ensure the column names are renamed to:

```
'10-digit PSGC' -> psgc_code
'Name' -> name
'Correspondence Code' -> correspondence_code
'Geographic Level' -> geographic_level
```

4. Remove all other columns from the dataset.
5. Import the cleaned dataset into your PostgreSQL database.

---

### 3.  Run Spring Boot Backend

From the root project directory, run the backend:

```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

You can also run it using your IDE (e.g., IntelliJ, Eclipse).

---

### 4.  Install Frontend Dependencies

Open a new terminal, navigate to the React Native folder, and run:

```bash
npm install
```

---

### 5.  Start Metro Bundler

Still in the frontend folder, start the Metro bundler:

```bash
npx react-native start
```

---

### 6.  Launch Android App

In a separate terminal, run the app on your Android emulator or physical device:

```bash
npx react-native run-android
```

> ðŸ“Œ Make sure your Android environment is properly set up and an emulator is running or a device is connected.

---

### 7.  Import PostGIS Extension

Make sure your database has the PostGIS extension enabled. Run the following SQL inside your PostgreSQL client:

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS postgis;
```

If you're using pgAdmin, go to the database, open the Query Tool, and paste the command above.

---
---
##  Authentication

The backend uses **JWT (JSON Web Token)** for secure, stateless user authentication.

*  Login returns a JWT token
*  Protected endpoints require the token in the `Authorization` header (as `Bearer <token>`)
*  Role-based access control is enforced using Spring Security filters

---

##  PSGC Location Mapping

* Imported **PSGC (Philippine Standard Geographic Code)** data from [psa.gov.ph/classification/psgc](https://psa.gov.ph/classification/psgc)
* Enables conversion of latitude/longitude into:

  * Barangay
  * Municipality/City
  * Province
  * Region
* Coordinates are matched against the official administrative boundaries using **PostGIS spatial queries**
* Ensures local ride data is aligned with real-world barangay boundaries for accurate reporting and search

---

##  Location Processing & Optimization

*  **GeometryFactory & Hibernate Spatial** â€“ Create and handle spatial objects
*  **PostGIS with Haversine Formula** â€“ Fast distance calculations
*  **Barangay-level reverse geocoding** using PSGC
*  **Threshold-based location updates** â€“ Avoids unnecessary data processing
*  **Map Snapshot Capture** â€“ Capture using **Mapbox**, store via **Cloudinary**

---

##  Future Enhancements

*  Integrate **Redis** for real-time user location caching
*  Add **WebSocket** support for live ride updates and messaging
*  Improve mobile UX for ride discovery and navigation
*  Write unit and integration tests for key modules
